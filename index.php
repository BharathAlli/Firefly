<h2>The Train Job</h2>
<h3>Season 1 | Episode 1</h3>
<p>
   Six years later, Mal is the captain of his own transport ship, an older-model Firefly-class
   vessel he named Serenity, and Zoe is his second-in-command. The rest of the ship crew 
   consists of Wash (Alan Tudyk), who is the pilot and is also Zoes husband, Kaylee 
   (Jewel Staite) the engineer, and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) the gun-for-hire. Inara 
   (Morena Baccarin), a "Companion" (i.e. Courtesan) who rents one of Serenitys
   two shuttles, normally travels with them, but she is currently away from the ship 
   on business.While the crew are illegally salvaging some crates off an abandoned spaceship, they are discovered by an Alliance cruiser. To escape capture, they deploy a decoy distress beacon. The Alliance cruiser falls for the diversion, but broadcasts a bulletin that a Firefly-class ship is carrying stolen Alliance goods.
   The crew of Serenity travel to Persephone, where they intend to deliver the stolen goods 
   to Badger (Mark Sheppard), the small-time gang leader who hired them for the heist. When 
   they meet with Badger, he reneges on their deal, partly because he is worried about the 
   Alliance broadcast on the rogue Firefly, and partly because he doesnt like the way Mal 
   looks down on him. Mal decides to try selling the cargo to Patience, an old business 
   associate who lives on Whitefall.

<h2>Bushwhacked</h2>
<h3>Season 1 | Episode 2</h3>
<p>
   Serenity encounters a drifting space craft which turns out to be a short-range scow converted 
   to a settler transport to the "Outer Planets". Mal decides to check out the derelict in order 
   to either help survivors or loot the dead. He sends his crew off in teams to explore the ship, 
   while he and Zoe head to a section that he suspects holds the more valuable supplies.They arrive 
   in a room, followed shortly by River who points out mutilated passengers hanging from the ceiling. 
   Mal knows what did this and orders everyone to regroup in the engine room, but en route Jayne is 
   hit from behind by an unseen attacker, whom Jayne shoots blindly 4 times. Mal finds the wounded 
   man hiding behind an air grate and they bring him back to the ship.As Simon treats the wounded man, 
   Mal announces that he must be the lone survivor of a Reaver attack. He explains how the Reavers 
   were driven insane after seeing the nothing at the "edge of the galaxy" and now commit unspeakable 
   acts of evil. He allows Shepherd Book and Simon to cut down the victims and give them a modest 
   ceremony, keeping them out of the way while Kaylee removes a Reaver booby trap that attached itself 
   to Serenity when they docked earlier.Once the derelicts cargo is aboard, Serenity moves to leave, 
   only to be stopped by an Alliance cruiser. The Feds board the ship and find Mal and everyone but River 
   and Simon innocently awaiting them, the retrieved cargo plainly in sight to avoid accusations of theft.
